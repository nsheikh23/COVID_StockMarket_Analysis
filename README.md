## OVERVIEW
In this project, a basic analysis of the stock market is performed to answer the following questions:

1. How has the stock market performed over the last few years?
2. How has the stock market performed YTD amidst COVID-19?
3. How did the stock market react in previous epidemics/pandemic?

## ANALYSIS
Throughout history, the stock market has proven to be resilient in the face of adversity. Since the beginning, the stock market has only climbed, with slight corrections along the way, however the general trends show and upward movement. COVID-19 appears to be no exception, as it manages to create an initial impact but the stock market quickly recovered and continued on its growth trajectory. Even though the number of cases and deaths in the US are alarming, the stock market appears unaffected. These trends are similar to how the stock market reacted to previous epidemics and pandemics. However, one thing that distinguishes COVID-19 from any previous pandemics is the unprecedented aide provided by the Federal and State governments. The assistance is one of the reasons the stock market appears to be defying reality. Therefore, this basic analysis does not provide any foundation to predict how the stock market will perform in the future.
